Timing for Connection Close:

Attempt 1: 0.00150 seconds

Attempt 2: 0.00130 seconds

Attempt 3:0.00107 seconds

Timing for Keep-Alive:

Attempt 1:  0.00113 Seconds

Attempt 2: 0.00089 Seconds

Attempt 3:  0.00098 Seconds


From this, we see that the Keep-Alive is faster on average. Logically, this makes sense. With the Connection-Close verison, every time we want to make a request, we have to 
create a whole new socket, which can take computer resources each time. On the other hand, with Keep-Alive, we are able to only make the socket connection once, so we don't need
to recreate every time we want to make a request.
